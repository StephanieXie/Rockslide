# Rockslide

Goal:  Try to avoid the boulders rolling at you (AKA the little green creeper) - if you get hit, it’s game over. 

Gameplay:  
  
A = move left  
D = move right  
W = raise arms  
S = lower arms  
ESC = pause  
  
- First, click on the screen before attempting to press any keys; this will “unfreeze” and begin the game. If the game is paused, click the screen to unpause.   

- Upon losing, the game will prompt you to enter your name for the scoreboard, then display your results. If you don’t wish to give your name, press “Cancel.” The page will automatically refresh afterward.
